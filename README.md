# JavaScript TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error and its solution.  The `bug.js` file contains code that throws a `TypeError` when an undefined value is passed to a function that expects an array. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to handle undefined values gracefully to prevent this error.
